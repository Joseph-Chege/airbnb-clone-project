## Team Roles

1.Business Analyst
A business analyst dives deep into a customer’s workflows and analyzes stakeholder feedback to help a client formulate what their wants look like and align a customer’s vision with what a development team is producing. They translate an abstract product idea into a set of tangible requirements. A business analyst may step in even before a software development team structure is defined and continue to bridge the gap between the customer and the team during later stages of development.

2.Product Owner
Holding more responsibility for a product’s success than any other development team member, a product owner is a decision-maker. Balancing both business needs and market trends, they define a business strategy, shape up the product vision, make sure it satisfies customer needs, and manage a product backlog.

3.Project Manager
In sequential models, a project manager is responsible for distributing tasks across team members, planning work activities, and updating project status.

In Agile projects where the focus is on self-management, transparency, and shared ownership, a PM sets up the vision of a product, maintains transparency, fosters communication, searches for improvements in the development process, and makes sure a team delivers more value with each iteration.

4.UI/UX Designer
A UI designer devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a product, while the UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s interaction with a product. A UX designer is thus involved in such activities as user research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, and more.

5.Software Architect
An architect is an expert-level software engineer who makes executive software design decisions on behalf of an app development team. You will need one if you deal with a software product with complex requirements or legacy software that calls for profound changes. A software architect decides which services and databases should communicate together, how integrations should work, and how to ensure that the product is secure and stable.

6.Software Developer
A software developer does the actual job and codes an application. And just like an app features a front end and a back end, there are front-end and back-end developers.

Front-end developers create the part of an application that users interact with, ensuring that an app offers an equally smooth experience to all—no matter the device, platform, or operational system.

Back-end developers, in turn, implement the core of an app—its algorithms and business logic. Experienced back-end developers not only write code but also do the tasks of an architect—for example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations.

There are full-stack developers as well. They can handle all the work at once—from clients to servers to databases and all the needed integrations.

7.Quality Assurance Engineer
The job of a quality assurance engineer is to verify whether an application meets the requirements—both functional and non-functional. Functional requirements define what an application should do, while non-functional requirements specify how it should do that. To verify both, QA specialists run various checks, followed by analyzing the test results and reporting on the application quality.

8.Test Automation Engineer
A test automation engineer is there to help you test faster and better. To enable that, they develop test automation scripts—small programs that provide reliable and continuous feedback on application quality without any human involvement.

A skilled test automation engineer would help you choose which parts of an application are suitable candidates for automation and what’s better to be tested manually.

9.DevOps Engineer
Even in Agile environments, development and operations teams can be siloed. DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable. Working together with software developers, system administrators, and operational staff, DevOps engineers oversee and facilitate code releases on a CI/CD basis.

## Feature Breakdown
1. API Documentation

The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard, ensuring developers have clear and structured guidelines for integration. By leveraging Django REST Framework for RESTful APIs and GraphQL for flexible queries, the system supports both standard CRUD operations and optimized data fetching, making the platform easier to extend and integrate with third-party tools.

OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.

2. User Authentication

This feature provides endpoints to register, authenticate, and manage user accounts securely. It ensures that only verified users can access protected resources, while allowing both hosts and guests to maintain profiles essential for property management and bookings.

Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

3. Property Management

Property management enables hosts to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. It forms the backbone of the application by providing guests with access to available accommodations and giving hosts full control over their listings.

Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

4. Booking System

The booking system allows guests to make reservations, update booking details, and manage check-in/check-out records. It ensures smooth coordination between guests and hosts, while also linking seamlessly with payments and property availability.

Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

5. Payment Processing

This feature manages all financial transactions tied to bookings, including payment initiation, tracking, and status updates. By handling payments securely and efficiently, it builds trust between guests and hosts while ensuring smooth revenue flow.

Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.

6. Review System

The review system allows guests to share feedback on their stays by posting ratings and comments. It promotes transparency and trust on the platform, helping future guests make informed decisions and motivating hosts to maintain high-quality standards.

Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.

7. Database Optimizations

Through indexing and caching strategies, the platform improves query performance and reduces server load. This ensures that frequently accessed data, such as property searches and booking records, is retrieved quickly, resulting in a smoother user experience.

Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.
